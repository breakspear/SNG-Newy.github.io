I am the group leader of the Systems Neuroscience Group with interests in computational neuroscience and translational neuroimaging. My contributions to the former focus on dynamic models of large-scale brain activity, toolbox development and the detection of nonlinear dynamics in empirical data. My work in translational imaging encompasses healthy ageing, dementia, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, with a focus on connectomics and risk prediction.

I grew up in Sydney and studied medicine, philosophy and mathematics. I undertook early career research training in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney before moving to the School of Psychiatry at UNSW as a mid-career researcher.

I formed the Systems Neuroscience Group at UNSW in Sydney in 2004, then moved to QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute from 2009. I relocated to Newcastle in 2019 and established the Systems Neuroscience Group, Newcastle (SNG-Newy) with aspirations to integrate basic methods, bioinformatics and clinical translation with a unique regional Australian character. Our imaging centre is in a beautiful bushland setting on Awabakal country.

In addition to basic research training, I also completed training in psychiatry and nowadays combine my research career with clinical sessions in adult psychiatry. I have an interest in recovery-focussed treatment of mood disorders, psychosis, and addiction. In the past I have worked in Prison Mental Health and Inner City community psychiatry.

I have a passion for climate science, being rather social, and surfing.
